## Features:

- A vagrantfile to Manage 3 VMs For Kubernertes Clusters (1 Cintrol node ans 2 worker nodes)
- Ansible playbook to automate the deployment the K8s clusters in the vagrant
- A simple Voting App deployed as containers into the kubernetes clusters
- Username nad Password Encrypted and stored as Kubernetes Secrets
- Persistence DB with Persitence Volume and PVC
- Application Scalability provided by Horizontal Pod AutoScaler (HPA with minreplica of 1 and Maximum Replica of 4 with Metrics of cpuUtilization)
- GitHub Workflow to Manage Code Scanning (with CodeQL) before Merging Pull requestsInfrastrucure Automation using Ansible

### Prerequisites

- A Linux workstation (I am using Ubuntu 20.10) with At least 8 GB of RAM and 15 GB of free hard disk space for the virtual machines.

> lsb_release -a

* Vagrant 2.2.16
> sudo apt install vagrant 

*VirtualBox
>sudo apt install virtualbox

*Ansible
>sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
>sudo apt install ansible

** File Structure

This code used to create a Kubernetes Cluster with Vagrant and Ansible is composed of:

- .vagrant/: hidden directory for Vagrant tracking. It includes a Vagrant generated Inventory file: vagrant_ansible_inventory that is used by Ansible to match virtual machines and roles.
add_packages: Ansible playbook to install/remove packages using APT in an Ubuntu system.

- roles/

- common/: installs the needed packages for Kubernetes (delegating in add_packages) and configures the common settings for Kubernetes master and nodes.

- k8s/master/: Ansible playbook to configure a Kubernetes master, it uses the common playbook for shared components between the Kubernetes master and the nodes.

- k8s/node/: Ansible playbook to configure a Kubernetes node, it uses the common playbook for shared components between the Kubernetes master and the nodes.

-  k8s.yml: Ansible playbook that uses the Kubernetes ansible roles.

- ditwl-k8s-01-join-command: this file is generated by the Kubernetes master and includes a temporary token and the command needed to join Kubernetes nodes to the cluster.

- Vagrantfile: contains the definition of the machines (CPU, memory, network and Ansible playbook and properties)

### To spin up the infrastructure run
git clone 

cd && vagrant up

* Kubernetes Network Overview
![Inkedansible-kubernetes-vagrant](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18261897/202597175-87a6f374-0938-43db-a3ad-5918ba862296.jpg)

*After installing a Kubernetes Cluster it is recommended to:
-   Check the health of the cluster
-   Check networking status
-   Install kubectl to administer the cluster using a command line

Connect to kubernetes Cluster on the Vagrant

>ssh k8s-m-1

*To check that all the necessary pods and services are running

>kubectl get pods â€“all-namespaces

*Install kubectl to administer the Kubernetes Cluster from your development host

>sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https

>curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -

>echo "deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list

>sudo apt-get update

>sudo apt-get install -y kubectl

**Copy the Kubernetes config to your local home .kube dir

To create the configuration directory
>mkdir -p ~/.kube

*Find the SSH port of the k8s-m-1 server
>vagrant port k8s-m-1

*The forwarded ports for the machine are listed below.
    22 (guest) => 2222 (host)

*Copy the file using scp
>scp -P 2222 vagrant@127.0.0.1:/home/vagrant/.kube/config ~/.kube/config

*List the Kubernetes cluster nodes using kubectl from your development host:
>kubectl cluster-info

*Deploy the Voter Application Microservices
>kubectl create -f  /voting-app/k8s-specifications

*This will deploy the voting app into the kubernetes clusters in the vagrant.

*Check if the pods are running:
>kubectl get po -n vote
